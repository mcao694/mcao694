# 👋 Hey there, it's Michelle!

I'm a budding scientist, lifelong learner, and creative at heart. 🌱

I'm currently a **fourth-year undergraduate student** studying **Environmental Science** and **Data Analytics** at **Dickinson College**. My passion lies at the intersections of **sustainability**, **social justice**, and **big tech/data**. Through my interdisciplinary education, I've gained opportunities to delve into these topics and expand my knowledge.

## 🎯 Key Projects & Experience

### Cornell Tech's Break Through Tech AI Program
As part of this program, I completed a **Machine Learning Foundation** course and had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with **Nestlé** on a project titled:
  
**FlavorGenius: Unleashing AI's Mastery in Flavor Discovery**

With the rise of wellness and clean eating trends, there is an increasing demand for healthy and tasty snacks that align with consumer preferences for both nutrition and flavor. As part of my collaboration with Nestlé in the Cornell Tech's Break Through Tech AI Program, our project aimed to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate novel flavor combinations for the rapidly growing healthy snack market.

### Honors Thesis (Dickinson College - Department of Environmental Studies & Science)
As part of my undergraduate research, I spent two semesters studying the spatiotemporal patterns of insecticide usage in Pennsylvania Forests with a specific focus on assessing potential hazards to bee populations. This project involved a combination of statistical analysis and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to explore several key questions:

- Which insecticides were applied?
- When and where were they applied?
- How much insecticide was used?

The findings from this research contribute to a larger effort to:

- Characterize insecticide usage across different land covers in Pennsylvania.
- Identify potential hazards to pollinators like bees.
- Model and predict insecticide usage trends across the United States

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools Used

Throughout my studies and projects, I have gained proficiency in a variety of programming languages and technologies, including:

### 💻 **Programming Languages**
- **Python**: Extensive experience with Python for data analysis, machine learning, and automation (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow).
- **R**: Used for statistical analysis and data visualization, especially in environmental science research.
- **SQL**: Applied for database management and querying large datasets.

### 📊 **Data Science & Machine Learning Tools**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras**: For machine learning and deep learning models.
