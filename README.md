# 👋 Hey there, it's Michelle!

Experienced Data Analyst & Environmental Researcher with keen interests in regenerative forestry and agriculture, natural resource conservation, and sustainable water management. 

I recently earned my BS in Environmental Science and Data Analytics from Dickinson College. I’m passionate about community-based science, applied research, and science outreach to engage diverse stakeholders and promote social justice, while addressing environmental challenges. My work revolves around leveraging technical tools and crunching numbers to communicate immportant findings to key stakeholders and the public. I'm eager to help make science more accessible and to make a difference in the communities we serve.

## 🎯 Research Projects & Experiences

### Forest Insecticides Research Project (Undergrad Honors Thesis)

In collaboration with Dr. Maggie Douglas of Dickinson College, I looked at insecticide application patterns in public PA forests and possible hazards on pollinators. With application data from the PA DCNR, we cleaned, visualized, mapped, and generated summary statistics on the types of insecticides applied, total area treated, intensity in which they were treated, and toxic load on honeybees. These findings were compared to agricultural statistics (see Douglas et al. 2022) to gain a better understanding of pest management in public forests and its effects on pollinator populations. 

Update: Our findings from PA forests will be combined with an analysis of WI forests and developed into a manuscript for publication.

### Methane Emissions from Dairy Cattle Research Project (NSF-REU)

In collaboration with Dr Hasan Seyyedhasani and Gian Putra, I 

### Cornell Tech's Break Through Tech AI Program
As part of this program, I completed a **Machine Learning Foundation** course and had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with **Nestlé** on a project titled:
  
**FlavorGenius: Unleashing AI's Mastery in Flavor Discovery**

With the rise of wellness and clean eating trends, there is an increasing demand for healthy and tasty snacks that align with consumer preferences for both nutrition and flavor. As part of my collaboration with Nestlé in the Cornell Tech's Break Through Tech AI Program, our project aimed to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate novel flavor combinations for the rapidly growing healthy snack market.



## 🛠️ Languages & Tools Used

Throughout my studies and projects, I have gained proficiency in a variety of programming languages and technologies, including:

### 💻 **Programming Languages**
- **Python**: Extensive experience with Python for data analysis, machine learning, and automation (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow).
- **R**: Used for statistical analysis and data visualization, especially in environmental science research.
- **SQL**: Applied for database management and querying large datasets.

### 📊 **Data Science & Machine Learning Tools**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras**: For machine learning and deep learning models.
